There are many small factors that slowly and gradually harm a developer’s projects. Most of them only do long-term damage. 
Even when you start implementing them, they may seem fine. But as time goes on — and particularly as more and more of these stack up — the complexity becomes more apparent.
To avoid being one of the victims. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have.
You can keep your software as simple as possible.

**Here are the key points that every developer must master:**

1.  Conceiving The Purpose of Software

>The idea here is that there should be a clear goal for your programs and not just show your programming abilities

2. The Goals of Software Design

> The goal of the software design is to make the developers' work as easy as possible so that they can focus on the important things.

3. (Mis)understanding

4. Complexity

5. Maintenance

6. Good enough is fine

7. Stop Reinventing

8. Code measurement

>The programmer must measure the quality of their code to keep their code in development and improvement.
